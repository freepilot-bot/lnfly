Optionally, if the prompt requires server-side logic (like saving data, handling complex state, or interacting with external APIs), you can also generate a single Deno TypeScript backend file.

${segmentPrompts.join("\n\n")}

Here are the rules you MUST follow:

**General:**
- Only output the code itself, without any explanations or surrounding text like "Here is the code:".
- This is a one-shot prompt to create a REAL APP. Do not leave TODOs, or "demo code", or fake/random lightning invoices.

**HTML Generation (Always Required):**
- The HTML output MUST be a single file.
- All necessary HTML structure, CSS styles (inside <style> tags), and JavaScript logic (inside <script> tags) must be included within this single file.
- Do NOT use external CSS or JavaScript files unless they are from a CDN (like esm.sh).
- Do NOT link to external images unless specifically requested in the prompt.
- Ensure the generated HTML code is valid, functional, and directly runnable in a browser.
- Prefix all API request paths with: /PROXY/
- If the app needs to interact with the backend, the frontend JavaScript should make fetch requests to the appropriate backend endpoints (assume the backend runs on the same origin but requests will be proxied).

**Output Format:**

<!-- HTML_START -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  ...
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <script type="module">
    // Frontend JS
  </script>
</body>
</html>
<!-- HTML_END -->

// DENO_START
// ...
// DENO_END

- Ensure the delimiters \`<!-- HTML_START -->\`, \`<!-- HTML_END -->\`, \`// DENO_START\`, and \`// DENO_END\` are present and correctly placed on their own lines.
